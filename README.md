## 📊 Project Objective

Analyze transaction and customer data to:
- Understand customer demographics and buying behavior for chips.
- Evaluate the performance of a price or placement trial run in select stores.
- Compare trial stores against matched control stores using statistical methods.
- Recommend whether the trial strategy should be scaled across other locations.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Customer Segmentation**: Chips are purchased across all life stage and affluence segments, but purchase patterns differ. Affluent-mainstream segments tend to buy more per visit, while budget-constrained customers purchase more frequently in smaller volumes.
  
- **Trial Store Impact**: Store 77 (trial store) saw a clear uplift in:
  - Total revenue
  - Number of customers
  - Average transaction size  
  Compared to its matched control store, this validates the success of the trial.

- **Other Stores**: Stores 86 and 88, which also underwent the trial, did not show significant performance differences compared to their controls.

## 🧠 Methods & Approach

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned, merged, and enriched transactional and customer datasets.
- **Feature Engineering**: Derived new variables like brand name, pack size, and customer segment.
- **A/B Testing**: Compared trial and control stores using pre-trial matching and statistical validation.
- **Visualization**: Used Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn) to generate visual insights and PowerPoint slides to present results.
